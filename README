statemachine.js is an implementation of a finite state machine.

A StateMachine is attached to a DOM element with two pieces of information:
	1. The description of the state machine
	2. The element which the StateMachine will be attached to.
	
The description of the state machine is expressed in JSON. Here is an example of the description for a StateMachine which will model a drag-and-drop interaction.

var drag_and_drop = {
	states: [
	{
		name: "start",
		transitions: [
			{
				input: "mouseDown", 
				action: record_down_location,
				endState: "down"
			}]
	},
	{
		name: "down",
		transitions: [
			{
				input: "mouseUp",
				action: do_drop,
				endState: "start"
			},
			{
				input: "mouseMove",
				action: move_icon,
				endState: "down"
			},
			{
				input: "mouseOut",
				action: move_out,
				endState: "start"
			}
		]
	}
	]
};

The StateMachine is created by simply calling:

var sm = new StateMachine(drag_and_drop, myElement);

The StateMachine can also supports probabilistic transitions.

For instance, if the user clicks the mouse, 50% of the time action A will be executed and the other 50% of the time action B will be executed.

Two boxes are able to be dragged on the screen. There are two state
machines on the same page. They work without issue.

Implementation of simple rubber-band line drawing with finite state machine.
Used slightly modified doodle-library from last project. Click at one point
in the window, move the mouse, and then click another point to finish line.
